# project-bioinformatic
This project is from an assginment when I was in my undergraduate final year for the bioinformatics course with Dr. Hallett. The purpose of the assignment was to wrangle taxonomy data from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), write functions to mimic the browser functionality of NCBI taxonomy browser (for example the code of part 11 will return the path to root organisms in the evolutionary history if you enter a name of taxon) and to analyze the abundance of number of species under each distinct domain and genera. The questions related to each code is found in this repository (these questions are helpful in understanding the purpose of each code segment).
